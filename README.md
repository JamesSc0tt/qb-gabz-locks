# qb-gabz-locks
## What's This?
I created this to manage the door locks on my server (OverlordRP - https://discord.gg/WPtdDpZNWr). I couldn't be bothered manually changing the config of qb-doorlock so built this to work with the configuration provided by Gabz

## How To?
/testint 1
/delint

## Requirements
 - qb-core (https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core)
 - qb-interior (https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-interior)
 - Gabz Subscription (https://www.gabzv.com/)

## Adding Locks
1) Extract the files provided by Gabz.
2) Upload the gabz-doorlocks file from `gabz-resourcedata/gabz-doorlocks` to `qb-gabz-locks/gabz-doorlocks`
3) Add `start qb-gabz-locks` to your server.cfg
